    <h1 id="DibrHISTORY" style="color: white" >THE HISTORY OF DIBRA </h1>

    <h4 style="color: white"> The name of the city of Dibra is mentioned since the fifth century BC by Herodotus, and later in the first century AD by Strabo and Pliny. These mention the Illyrian tribe, the tribe of the Dobers, who founded their city named Dober. Ptolemy in the second century of our era confirms in his maps the plan of the city called Dober or Doberos and its inhabitants Doberets. Archaeological and historical research so far confirms that Dibra is the successor of the city of Doberos, from which the present name Dibër derives. Dibra was a well-known commercial and handicraft center in the past and played an important role in the history of this region. This city was the main crossroads of this region through which the Via Egnatia also passed. In 1502, it was recognized as an important civic center. In the 30-40s of the century XIX, had nearly 8400 inhabitants and 250 shops, and was one of the most important economic centers. In 1909, the Dibra Congress was held in Dibër, this congress, although it was organized by the Young Turks and brought little service to the National Movement, for the first time he first made it possible for the Albanian language to be taught in schools in a legal way within the Ottoman Empire. Until 1911, Dibra was one of the most developed countries in the region in terms of economy, crafts, trade, constructions and its special architecture but also on the cultural-social level. At that time, Dibra had 10,000 inhabitants and 489 shops. But after the turmoil and the Balkan wars, this country lost its importance, so that today it is one of the most underdeveloped countries in Macedonia. Dibra is a city without villages, since most of the villages remained beyond the borders, practically in Albania. The city suffered economic degradation and all-round cultural degradation.</h4><br><br><br><br>

  <p id="tekst5" class="show">Boil the chicken in salted water in a pressure cooker for 15 minutes. I use corn-fed chicken, from the yellow ones, as they are tastier. Then we cut it into pieces, or leave it whole if desired. DONE
Place the pasta in a pan and sprinkle half of the butter on the surface. Bake them at 250°C until they take on a reddish color on all sides, stirring occasionally. Add the strained chicken stock until the noodles are covered a finger below their level (I needed 5 cups of tea), place the chicken pieces on the surface, a few sprigs of thyme, the rest of the butter and bake for 20-25 minutes, until the pasta has completely absorbed the liquid. DONE
This is the variant of how I prepare chicken noodles in the oven. If desired, you can add onions fried in butter, tomatoes, oregano, etc. We like them flavored with just a little thyme.</p>

Melt the butter in a pan, skimming off the foam, and after it has taken on a golden color and has a good aroma, remove it from the heat. After it cools down, add the eggs and mix well until it becomes a manageable mass. Then we add the flour and mix it well again until we get the right amount as a slightly hard dough but to create a grain. I arranged them in the pan and decorated the grains a little.

2 glasses of water
250 or 300 g of raisins
400 grams of sugar
cinnamon and cloves for flavor.
A little butter for frying the rice (3 or 4 tablespoons)

Preparation:

In a pot, melt the butter and then add the rice (rinsed from the dirt before) and start stirring it together, frying it a little. The rice should get a slightly reddish color during frying. After the rice is fried, add the water and stir while adding the water. Then let the rice boil. After the water runs out and the rice is well cooked, remove it from the heat and let it cool for approximately 5 minutes (because when the rice is very hot, the sugar melts immediately).
In another container, we begin to lay a layer of rice and on its surface we add the open sugar evenly, cinnamon, raisins and a little clove for flavor. Then we start with the next layer, the same procedure as before, until we reach the last layer.
Even on the surface of the last layer, add sugar, cinnamon, raisins and some cloves. Once the rice is a little warm, cover it with another container to melt the sugar. A sherbet-like brown liquid will form at the bottom of the pot, which is the melted sugar. Then the kabounia is ready and can be served.</p>
